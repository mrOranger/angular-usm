# UserManagementSystem

This project is a simple example of an angular application for users' management, while the backend is a Laravel REST service. You can register and login to your personal account, delete, update or remove an user insite the MySQL database. This is just an example, to verify my knowledge about Angular, and it is not in any way a complete operative system.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.2.6.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
